## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned a lot about Tailwind CSS and have really enjoyed working with it, even for such a small project. I felt it boosted my productivity significantly and I look forward to using it more. Same for NextJS. I have yet to scratch the surface of what I can do with this framework.

### Continued development

Going forward I'll continue to focus on exploring ReactJS / NextJS and Tailwind CSS. For the next project I shall increase the complexity by a notch. More componets, more logic, more functionality. I feel like I have a good grip of vanilla JavaScript, so now I want to translate that experience to the frameworks. I'm excited for my next challenge.
